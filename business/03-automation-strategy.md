# Automation Strategy: Areas & Priorities

## Automation Framework Overview

### Strategic Approach
Transform PsiZero from manual operations to an intelligent, largely autonomous business platform through targeted automation across five core domains:

1. **Customer Lifecycle Management**
2. **Financial Operations** 
3. **Technical Operations**
4. **Sales & Marketing**
5. **Business Intelligence**

### Automation Principles
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Maintain strategic oversight while automating tactical execution
- **Gradual Deployment**: Phased rollout with validation at each stage
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Automated rollback and escalation mechanisms
- **Continuous Learning**: AI models that improve from outcomes and feedback
- **Transparent Operations**: Full audit trails and explainable decisions

- **Limited Insights**: Basic usage metrics without behavioral analysis
- **Inconsistent Experience**: Varies based on available attention

### Target State
- **78% Automated**: Proactive engagement and intervention
- **Predictive Approach**: Issues prevented before they occur
- **Rich Insights**: Behavioral patterns and predictive analytics
- **Consistent Experience**: Standardized, high-quality interactions
