## Business Process Analysis

### Current Manual Processes

#### Customer Lifecycle Management (85% Manual)
```mermaid
graph TD
    LEAD[Lead Generation] --> QUALIFY[Manual Qualification]
    QUALIFY --> TRIAL[Trial Setup]
    TRIAL --> ONBOARD[Manual Onboarding]
    ONBOARD --> MONITOR[Manual Health Monitoring]
    MONITOR --> SUPPORT[Reactive Support]
    SUPPORT --> RENEW[Manual Renewal Process]
    
    QUALIFY -.->|High Touch| SALES[Sales Outreach]
    MONITOR -.->|Issues Detected| INTERVENTION[Manual Intervention]
    RENEW -.->|Churn Risk| RETENTION[Retention Efforts]
```

**Pain Points:**
- Lead qualification relies on manual review
- Onboarding requires individual attention
- Customer health monitoring is reactive
- Support tickets need manual triage
- Upgrade opportunities missed due to lack of proactive outreach

#### Financial Operations (70% Manual)
```mermaid
graph TD
    USAGE[Usage Tracking] --> BILLING[Invoice Generation]
    BILLING --> PAYMENT[Payment Processing]
    PAYMENT --> FAILURE{Payment Failed?}
    FAILURE -->|Yes| MANUAL[Manual Recovery]
    FAILURE -->|No| SUCCESS[Success]
    
    USAGE --> ANALYSIS[Manual Usage Analysis]
    ANALYSIS --> PRICING[Pricing Decisions]
    PRICING --> IMPLEMENTATION[Manual Implementation]
```

**Pain Points:**
- Payment failure recovery requires manual intervention
- Usage pattern analysis is time-intensive
- Pricing optimization decisions lack data-driven insights
- Revenue forecasting is spreadsheet-based
- Cost optimization opportunities missed

#### Technical Operations (60% Manual)
```mermaid
graph TD
    MONITOR[System Monitoring] --> ALERT[Alert Generation]
    ALERT --> TRIAGE[Manual Triage]
    TRIAGE --> RESPONSE[Manual Response]
    RESPONSE --> RESOLUTION[Problem Resolution]
    
    MONITOR --> CAPACITY[Capacity Planning]
    CAPACITY --> MANUAL_ANALYSIS[Manual Analysis]
    MANUAL_ANALYSIS --> SCALING[Manual Scaling Decisions]
```

**Pain Points:**
- Alert triage requires technical expertise
- Capacity planning is reactive rather than predictive
- Performance optimization requires manual analysis
- Cost optimization opportunities missed
- Documentation updates lag behind changes
